## Research Projects
### **Flavour Oscillations in the Reissner-Nordström spacetime** &#124; `4th year Thesis` &#124; `MAY 2022`

**Highlight: This research contributed novel findings that align with the established scientific literature.**

Conducted a research investigation centred on the oscillatory behaviour of neutrinos in the vicinity of a charged black hole. Followed by intricate computations to determine the phase discrepancy between different neutrino flavours when two beams underwent gravitational lensing.

### **Literature Review on Neutrino Oscillations in Schwarzchild spacetime** &#124; `Report` &#124; `OCT 2022 - DEC 2022`

Compilation of key discoveries related to neutrino oscillations, encompassing existing knowledge and the outstanding inquiries yet to be resolved. Thorough review of all derivations and calculations were conducted.

### **Dark Matter and Cosmic Structure Formation** &#124; `Report` &#124; `DEC 2022`

Project on cosmological perturbation theory and its role in the formation of large scale structures: from primordial fluctuations to CMB anisotropies. Review of the cosmological origin of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), the violation of the slow rolls parameters and the enhanced power spectrum. Followed by the review of mass constraints from astrophysical sources. Generated some original code.

### **Investigating the Dirac equation using Supersymetric Quantum Mechanics (SUSYQM)** &#124; `3rd year Thesis` &#124; `APR 2022`

Investigation of the SUSYQM framework applied to the 1+1 Dirac equation. The project was followed by a detailed analysis of the fractionalisation of charge in a topological soliton field.
