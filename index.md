# Fannie Vaquero

**MSci. Theoretical Physics &#124; Problem Solver &#124; Teacher**

Aspiring theoretical physicist and MSci graduate looking for a PhD position. My research interets include: Dark matter, baryogenesis, large scale structures, early cosmology, neutrinos and beyond the standard model. My career goal is to advance our understanding of fundamental aspects of the universe and contribute to cutting-edge research.  I also aspire to share my knowledge and enthusiasm for these subjects by teaching at a university level.

## Projects
### **Flavour Oscillations in the Reissner-Nordström spacetime** &#124; `Thesis` &#124; `MAY 2022`

**Highlight: This research contributed novel findings that align with the established scientific literature.**

Conducted a research investigation centred on the oscillatory behaviour of neutrinos in the vicinity of a charged black hole. Followed by intricate computations to determine the phase discrepancy between different neutrino flavours when two beams underwent gravitational lensing.

### **Literature Review on Neutrino Oscillations in Schwarzchild spacetime** &#124; `Report` &#124; `OCT 2022 - DEC 2022`

Compilation of key discoveries related to neutrino oscillations, encompassing existing knowledge and the outstanding inquiries yet to be resolved. Thorough review of all derivations and calculations were conducted.

### **Dark Matter and Cosmic Structure Formation** &#124; `Report` &#124; `DEC 2022`

Project on cosmological perturbation theory and its role in the formation of large scale structures.  Review of the cosmological origin of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and examining its mass constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Generated some original code.

### **Investigating the Dirac equation using Supersymetric Quantum Mechanics (SUSYQM)** &#124; `Thesis` &#124; `APR 2022`

Investigation of the SUSYQM framework applied to the 1+1 Dirac equation. The project was followed by a detailed analysis of the fractionalisation of charge in a topological soliton field.
